## Grocery Organizer Web
I am working on a CakePHP project that has a **MySQL Database**. The project is called Grocery Organizer Web. It should allow the user to:
- Maintain a recipie book with an underlying list groceries shared between recipies
- Allow "Composite Recipies" that have two purposes:
1. Allow features of a recipe to be shared amongst other recipies e.g. a common gardan salad can be a component of Spaghettie Bolognaise (with salad) as well as Enchiladas (with salad).
2. Allow an itinerary of meals e.g. Spaghetti Bolognaise, Enchiladas and Hamburgers.
- A recipie (fundamentally a grocery list) can be viewed as a shopping list groups of groceries or "Bays" can be listed under stores, stores can be changed and groceries can be checked as "aquired" - regardles of which store filter is used if a grocery is acquired it is acquired.
